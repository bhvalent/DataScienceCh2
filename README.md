There is a folder with political party nomination speeches
and a file of words with a value ranged from -1 to 1.
-1 meaning it is a negative word and 1 being a positive word.

The speech files, lexicon file, and the code have to be in the same directory.

The code asks for a file in the command line reffering to 
which speech you want to analyze.

The final product makes a bar graph telling how many 
strongly negative, weakly negative, neutral, weakly positive, and 
strongly positive words the speech has.
